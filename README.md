# pedigree-aware-gwas-workflow

Reproducible pedigree-aware GWAS preprocessing and association analysis workflow using PLINK and ClassicMendel, demonstrated with simulated genomic data.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a pedigree-aware GWAS preprocessing and analysis workflow inspired by analyses conducted on large whole-genome sequencing cohorts for neurodevelopmental disorders. To protect participant privacy and comply with data governance requirements, the included examples use simulated data and generalized file paths while preserving the structure and methodology of real-world analyses.

## Key Features
- Pedigree-aware association testing using ClassicMendel
- Variant-level QC and filtering with PLINK
- Support for family-based and trio datasets
- Modular and reproducible workflow design

## Scientific Context
The workflow is applicable to studies investigating inherited genetic variation, haplotype structure, and repeat expansion risk in complex human traits.

## Reproducibility
All scripts are designed to be portable and reproducible. Software versions and dependencies are documented, and simulated data are provided for demonstration purposes.
