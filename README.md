# pedigree-aware-gwas-workflow
Reproducible pedigree-aware GWAS preprocessing and association analysis workflow using PLINK and ClassicMendel, demonstrated with simulated genomic data.

“This repository demonstrates a pedigree-aware GWAS preprocessing and analysis workflow inspired by analyses conducted on large autism spectrum disorder whole-genome sequencing cohorts. To protect participant privacy, the included example uses simulated data and generalized file paths.”
