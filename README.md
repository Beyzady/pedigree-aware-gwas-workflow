# pedigree-aware-gwas-workflow

Reproducible pedigree-aware GWAS preprocessing and association analysis workflow using PLINK and ClassicMendel, demonstrated with simulated genomic data.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a pedigree-aware GWAS preprocessing and analysis workflow inspired by analyses conducted on large whole-genome sequencing cohorts for neurodevelopmental disorders. To protect participant privacy and comply with data governance requirements, the included examples use simulated data and generalized file paths while preserving the structure and methodology of real-world analyses.
